# Aurora Series

The Aurora Series is a series of (split) keyboard kits made by [splitkb.com](https://splitkb.com). In this repository you'll find files you can use to make your own case for these keyboards.

These files are available for non-commercial use only. You explicitly have permission to make objects with these files for yourself, friends, family and coworkers.

## Supported keyboards

You'll find folders in this repository, where each keyboard gets its own folder. Does your keyboard not have a folder yet? Then we're working on adding the files still. Feel free to [join our Discord server](https://splitkb.com/discord) for status updates and questions.

## Which files do I need?

1. Look for the folder of your keyboard.
2. Decide whether you need kerf (see below: What's kerf?).
3. Pick the files for your keyboard.
    - You'll generally always want a top plate.
    - If you're using a puck, you'll want a puck-compatible bottom plate. If not, the regular plate is fine.
    - If your keyboard supports OLED display covers, you'll want those too.

All files are symmetrical, meaning you use the same file for both the left and the right side. When ordering parts, make sure you order two of every file you've selected.

## What's kerf?

Kerf is the amount of material that's lost in the process of cutting, for example with a laser or water jet. As the cutter moves along the lines in the file, material is removed from either side of the line. Files that account for kerf, add a little bit of material to the edges of all cut lines to compensate for that lost material.

In short, if you're using a laser cutter yourself, you'll want the files with kerf. If you're sending them off to another service, you should ask them whether to include kerf. And if you're 3D printing, you shouldn't need any kerf.

The files with kerf that we supply are used with our own laser cutter. Third parties might require different settings. We don't supply those files, so you or the third party may have to modify the files to match their process.

## Which thickness do I need?

It depends! Generally:

- For MX switches, 1.5mm is best for the top plate if the material is sturdy enough. For acrylic, go with 3mm.
- For Choc switches, 1.2mm is best for the top plate if the material is sturdy enough. 1.5mm is also fine, and in most cases this makes it compatible with both MX and Choc. For acrylic, go with 3mm and a hand-solderable kit. Hot swapping 3mm plates makes for a bad experience.
- For the bottom plate and OLED cover, thickness doesn't matter a lot. We usually go with 3mm for acrylic.

## Which hardware do I need?

Depending on the thickness of your selected materials, you might need different length spacers and screws. We sell many sizes in our shop for convenience:

- [M2 spacers in various lenghts](https://splitkb.com/products/brass-m2-spacers)
- [M2 screws in various lenghts](https://splitkb.com/products/m2-screws)
- The [Aurora Low Profile Case Hardware Kit](https://splitkb.com/collections/cases-and-plates/products/aurora-sweep-low-profile-case?variant=43400836841731) is sold on each Aurora case page, and contains many of the spacers and screws you need already.
